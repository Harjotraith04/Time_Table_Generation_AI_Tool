# Advanced Timetable Generation Algorithm

## Overview

The Hybrid Advanced Timetable Generator is a state-of-the-art scheduling algorithm that combines multiple optimization techniques to handle complex timetabling constraints. This algorithm is specifically designed to address real-world challenges in academic scheduling, including core vs elective subjects, batch management, and multi-level constraint satisfaction.

## Key Features

### 1. **Core vs Elective Subject Management**
- **Core Subjects**: Mandatory courses that apply to all students in a program
  - Cannot have overlapping schedules within the same student group
  - Given highest priority in scheduling
  - Scheduled first to ensure optimal placement
  
- **Elective Subjects**: Optional courses with flexible constraints
  - Can run in parallel if taught by different teachers
  - Grouped into elective categories for optimization
  - Support for multiple batches and parallel sessions

### 2. **Batch Scheduling Support**
- **Parallel Batch Execution**: Multiple batches of the same course can run simultaneously
- **Capacity Management**: Automatic batch creation based on student count and room capacity
- **Lab Session Optimization**: Special handling for practical sessions requiring smaller groups

### 3. **Advanced Constraint Satisfaction**
- **Hard Constraints**: Must be satisfied (teacher conflicts, room conflicts, core subject conflicts)
- **Soft Constraints**: Preferential but flexible (teacher preferences, workload balance)
- **Multi-level Priority System**: Different priority levels for different types of courses

### 4. **Hybrid Optimization Techniques**

#### A. Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Solver
- **Domain Filtering**: Reduces search space by eliminating invalid assignments
- **Arc Consistency**: Ensures constraint propagation throughout the solution
- **Intelligent Variable Ordering**: Prioritizes most constrained courses first

#### B. Simulated Annealing
- **Global Optimization**: Escapes local optima through probabilistic acceptance
- **Temperature Control**: Adaptive cooling schedule for exploration vs exploitation
- **Convergence Criteria**: Multiple stopping conditions for optimal performance

#### C. Tabu Search
- **Memory-based Search**: Prevents cycling through previously visited solutions
- **Aspiration Criteria**: Allows forbidden moves if they lead to better solutions
- **Diversification**: Periodic random restarts to explore new solution spaces

#### D. Local Search Intensification
- **Final Optimization**: Intensive local improvement of the best solution
- **Neighborhood Exploration**: Systematic examination of solution variations
- **Greedy Improvement**: Hill-climbing for final refinement

## Algorithm Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialization and Data Processing
1. **Course Categorization**
   - Identify core subjects and elective groups
   - Process batch information and dependencies
   - Create constraint satisfaction domains

2. **Domain Generation**
   - Generate valid time slots for each course
   - Filter classrooms based on requirements
   - Validate teacher assignments and availability

### Phase 2: Initial Solution Construction
1. **Core Subject Scheduling**
   - Schedule all core subjects first with strict constraints
   - Ensure no conflicts within student groups
   - Prioritize by student count and complexity

2. **Elective Group Optimization**
   - Schedule elective courses with parallel session support
   - Optimize for teacher utilization and room assignment
   - Handle inter-course dependencies

3. **Remaining Course Assignment**
   - Schedule any remaining courses
   - Apply local optimization techniques
   - Ensure constraint satisfaction

### Phase 3: Hybrid Optimization
1. **Simulated Annealing with Tabu Search**
   - Iterative improvement with memory-based search
   - Temperature-controlled acceptance criteria
   - Tabu list management for move restrictions

2. **Diversification Strategies**
   - Periodic solution randomization
   - Exploration of new solution spaces
   - Convergence detection and restart mechanisms

3. **Final Intensification**
   - Intensive local search on best solution
   - Systematic neighborhood exploration
   - Greedy improvement for final optimization
